## about me

<!-- **Civil engineering --\> Statistics & Data Science** -->

<!-- **Hong Kong --\> The Netherlands** -->

Freddy recently graduated from the Master in Statistics and Data Science 
in the Leiden University, the Netherlands. Prior to the study, he has 
worked as a civil / water engineer in Hong Kong specialized in large-scale 
sewerage infrastructure since graduating with the bachelor degree in civil 
engineering. His career goal is to contribute to ambitious project dedicated to
public good by leveraging his knowledge and potential in statistics 
and data science. <!-- public good = healthcare, climate change -->

He is highly motivated to apply statistics / data science / machine learning
techniques to analyze and solve problems posing interesting challenges
e.g. stochastic, complex, dynamic, uncertainty etc.. That's why he loves to 
learn about new techniques and new data. Just as what Richard Feynmann said, 
‚ÄúStudy hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent 
and original manner possible.‚Äù

To deliver a better solution, he believes in following principles:

-   clear problem definition
-   streamlined and proactive communication
-   mutual trust
-   roleplaying
-   forward planning
-   balance between time, cost and effect
-   balance between exploration and exploitation
-   suitable performance metric(s)/criteria
-   systematic workflow
-   positive feedback loop
-   sensitivity analysis
-   can-do spirit, result-oriented execution

He values good teamwork (1+1\>2) and enjoys working in a diverse environment 
that encourage growth, curiosity and cultural/intellectual exchange. Apart 
from a positive impact, a memory worth cherishing means a lot to the motivation 
and satisfaction of a job.

Currently, he is living in Rotterdam. (Surprise, surprise, the portrait
photo was taken at Kinderdijk!)

[üß∞skills], and [üòçhobbies] below.

## üèãÔ∏èeducation

**Master in Statistics and Data Science** \| 2020 - Aug 2022
\|

Leiden University, The Netherlands

**Bachelor in Civil and Structural Engineering** \| 2009 - 2012 \|

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üë®‚Äçüç≥recent works

He has completed his thesis project in 2022 and graduated from the Master 
of Statistics and Data Science, Leiden Univeristy. The thesis focused on 
comparing various novel statistics modelling methods that predict progression 
into dementia using longitudinal data on dataset obtained from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. The statistical computing 
was carried out in R with the used of ALICE High Performance Computing 
facility at Leiden University.

Recently, he has created a [flashcard app](https://ik-weet-het-niet-train-your-memory.streamlit.app/) 
based on the Spaced Repetition method using Streamlit (Python) to 
memorize Dutch words better.

During his spare time, he loves to follow the development in sports 
data science (mainly football) and explores approaches to extract 
actionable and interpretable insights from various forms of data i.e. 
event data, tracking data, and journal data. For example:

-   passing networks
    - aggregation of passing statistics to a team-based network
-   spatial control model
    - pobability model describing the tendency 
of a team winning the ball at certain point on the football pitch

He is also trying to build a system to optimize and automate the
decision making for the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game, in which a
player needs to manage a portfolio of football players to score points
based on the their events on field every game week, by modelling
football events' data generating process and searching / evaluating
competing strategies.

## üßóexperience

**Assistant Engineer** \| 2016 - 2020 \| AECOM, Hong Kong

**Assistant Resident Engineer** \| 2014 - 2016 \| AECOM, Hong Kong

**Graduate Engineer** \| 2012 - 2014 \| AECOM, Hong Kong

After graduation from a civil engineering bachelor, Freddy joined the
water engineering discipline of AECOM, one of the leading engineering
consultant companies in Hong Kong.

Over the eight years in AECOM, he gained an extensive, end-to-end
experience from multiple public sewerage projects that covered most
types of infrastructure, including sewer, sewage pumping station (
rioolgemaal), and sewage treatment works (rioolwaterzuiveringsinstallatie).

The planning and design of the [Yuen Long Effluent Polishing
Plant](http://www.hkengineer.org.hk/issue/vol50-jan2022/cover_story/)
(YLEPP) is one of the vivid highlights in his engineering career. The
project aims at replacing an aging sewage treatment works to support the
future population growth in the Yuen Long district of Hong Kong. As a
part of the project management and core design team, he collaborated
with professionals from several disciplines, including electrical &
mechanical engineers, sewage & sludge treatment engineers, geotechnical
engineers, architects, and stakeholders to come up with an integrated
design to overcome several non-trivial challenges and achieve the design
visions of being green, smart, and resilient. <!-- Add some links -->
<!-- His contribution mainly includes -->
<!-- show them the sewage cycle -->

The notion of smart design above, as materialized in the application of
Building Information Modelling (BIM) and the pursuit to leverage
artificial intelligence to optimize the future plant operation /
maintenance, eventually inspired him to explore the vast universe of
data science - one of the key components for [digital
twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin#Urban_planning_and_the_construction_(built_environment)_industry)
and [smart cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city).
