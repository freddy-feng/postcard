## about me

<!-- **Civil engineering --\> Statistics & Data Science** -->

<!-- **Hong Kong --\> The Netherlands** -->

Freddy is an international student from Hong Kong on track of completing
his master study in Statistics and Data Science in the Leiden
University, the Netherlands.

Prior to the study, he has worked as a civil / water engineer in Hong
Kong specialized in sewerage infrastructure since graduating with the
bachelor degree in civil engineering.

He loves to apply statistics / data science / machine learning
techniques to analyze and solve problems posing interesting challenges
e.g. stochastic, complex, dynamic etc.. To deliver a good solution, he
believes in:

-   clear problem definition
-   effective internal and external communication
-   can-do and result-oriented spirit
-   forward planning
-   balance between time, cost, effect
-   balance between exploration and exploitation
-   appropriate performance metric(s)

<!-- the notion of solution is not clear here, better than heuristics or what. what is the end point -->

He values good teamwork (1+1\>2) and enjoys working in a diverse
environment that encourage growth and curiosity.

<!-- In football terms, he enjoys providing assists and good passes, and -->

<!-- devotes into both attacking and defending actions. -->

[üß∞skills], and [üòçhobbies] below.

<!-- It's not always easy, especially inference but challenging.  -->

<!-- communicate the solutions with stakeholders -->

<!-- open-minded, inclusive, commitment, stoic, direct, holistic thinking, ... some pep talk shit here. I love to play the role of No. 8 in a football team, loves to assist but not afraid of making shots. but don't mind to go solo -->

## üèãÔ∏èeducation

**Master in Statistics and Data Science** \| 2020 - Aug 2022 (tentative)
\|

Leiden University, The Netherlands

**Bachelor in Civil and Structural Engineering** \| 2009 - 2012 \|

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üßóexperience

**Assistant Engineer** \| 2016 - 2020 \| AECOM, Hong Kong

**Assistant Resident Engineer** \| 2014 - 2016 \| AECOM, Hong Kong

**Graduate Engineer** \| 2012 - 2014 \| AECOM, Hong Kong

After graduation from a civil engineering bachelor, Freddy joined the
water engineering discipline of AECOM, one of the leading engineering
consultant companies in Hong Kong.

Over the eight years in AECOM, he gained an extensive, end-to-end
experience from multiple public sewerage projects that covered most
types of infrastructure, including sewer, sewage pumping station (Dutch:
rioolgemaal), and sewage treatment works (Dutch:
rioolwaterzuiveringsinstallatie, RWZI).

The planning and design of the [Yuen Long Effluent Polishing
Plant](http://www.hkengineer.org.hk/issue/vol50-jan2022/cover_story/)
(YLEPP) is one of the vivid highlights in his engineering career. The
project aims at replacing an aging sewage treatment works to support the
future population growth in the Yuen Long district of Hong Kong. As a
part of the project management and core design team, he collaborated
with professionals from several disciplines, including electrical &
mechanical engineers, sewage & sludge treatment engineers, geotechnical
engineers, architects, and stakeholders to come up with an integrated
design to overcome several non-trivial challenges and achieve the design
visions of being green, smart, and resilient. <!-- Add some links -->
<!-- His contribution mainly includes -->
<!-- show them the sewage cycle -->

The notion of smart design above, as materialized in the application of
Building Information Modelling (BIM) and the pursuit to leverage
artificial intelligence to optimize the future plant operation /
maintenance, eventually inspired him to explore the vast universe of
data science - one of the key components for [digital
twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin#Urban_planning_and_the_construction_(built_environment)_industry)
and [smart cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city).

<!-- He believes the promising future of Digital Twins, smart city -->

<!-- other project experience also includes drainage system, and Wan Chai Development Phase II, Hong Kong -->

<!-- which involves reclamation, tunnel and roads in one of the central business districts in Hong Kong. -->

<!-- also mention the modelling works and pollution load inventory? -->

<!-- due to COVID-19, sports analytics -->

<!-- The root also goes back to the final year project of bachelor days, -->

<!-- optimal design of structures using MCMC optimization. -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üë®‚Äçüç≥recent works

Currently, he is working on the thesis project of comparing various
novel statistics modelling methods that predict progression into
dementia using longitudinal data on dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative study.

During his spare time, he follows the development in sports data science
(mainly football) and explores approaches to extract actionable and
interpretable insights from various forms of data i.e. event data,
tracking data, and journal data. For example:

-   passing networks
-   spatial control models

He is also trying to build a system to optimize and automate the
decision making for the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game, in which a
player needs to manage a portfolio of football players to score points
based on the their events on field every game week, by modelling
football events' data generating process and searching / evaluating
competing strategies.
